# AI LLM Projects

Welcome to this repository showcasing various **Generative AI**, **AI**, and **Large Language Model (LLM)** projects! This repository includes a collection of my personal projects, experiments, and contributions in the field of AI. Each project focuses on different aspects of artificial intelligence, from natural language processing (NLP) to audio analysis and Q&A systems.

## About This Repository

This repository is a place where I demonstrate my expertise and passion for AI, specifically in the areas of generative models, LLMs, and more. Projects in this repository are intended to show both the practical and theoretical applications of AI technologies.

### Technologies Used:
- **Generative AI**
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: LLaMA, GPT, Whisper
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Streamlit** for web applications
- **Python**
- **Groq API** for efficient processing
- **OpenAI Whisper** for speech-to-text

## Current Projects:

### **Whisper-Llama Project**
This project demonstrates the integration of **Whisper (OpenAI)** for audio transcription and **LLaMA 3** for question-answering based on the transcribed text. It's a simple web-based app built with **Streamlit** that allows users to upload an audio file, transcribe it to text, and ask questions based on the transcription.

#### Key Features:
- **Audio to Text**: Upload an audio file, and the app will transcribe it to text using the Whisper model.
- **Text Analysis**: Ask questions based on the transcribed text, and the app will provide answers using LLaMA 3.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with Groq API for fast processing, ensuring a responsive user experience.
- **Web App Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a simple, interactive user interface.

#### How to Run This Project Locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daniyaljunjua/AI-LLM-Projects.git
    ```

### **Finetune LLMs to Write Job Descriptions**
This project focuses on using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automatically generate high-quality job descriptions. It leverages fine-tuning techniques on pre-trained models to tailor them for job description writing. The project includes the development of a Jupyter notebook that fine-tunes an LLM to write detailed, industry-specific job descriptions.

#### Key Features:
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models to specialize in writing job descriptions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring job-related data to improve model performance.
- **Custom Job Descriptions**: Generate tailored job descriptions for different roles and industries.
- **Interactive Notebook**: The project is contained in a Jupyter notebook for easy experimentation and further development.

#### How to Run This Project Locally:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daniyaljunjua/AI-LLM-Projects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `finetune-llms-to-write-job-description/` folder and open the notebook:
    ```bash
    cd finetune-llms-to-write-job-description
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Future Projects

This repository will continue to grow as I work on more generative AI and LLM-related projects. Stay tuned for additional examples of AI applications, including:

- Text generation with GPT-3 or GPT-4
- Image generation using generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Chatbots powered by large language models
- Text Classification with LLaMA 3
- Advanced NLP projects and much more!
